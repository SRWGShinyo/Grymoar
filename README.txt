This directory is the one of 'Grymoar', a game made in 48 hours during the Mini Jam 41.
The theme of the jam was 'Magic', the constraint 'Only One Screen'.

In this game, you play as Sarah the Witch, lost away from home. You have to use the spells
you can find, in order to pass every level and get back to your house.
The game is easily finishable, quick, and aims to be cool. No real punishment for dieing,
take your time and, most of all, have fun !
